# HR-analytics-IN-Tableau
Transforming HR Data into Insightful Action 💡

I recently completed an HR Analytics project using Tableau to visualize employee trends, diversity, and attrition at Atlas Labs. 

This dashboard empowers HR teams to make data-driven decisions— from tracking hiring patterns to improving diversity and inclusion initiatives.

The HR dashboard provides a comprehensive view of employee demographics, hiring trends, and attrition rates. Key insights revealed that most employees are between 20–29 years old, women make up 2.7% more of the workforce than men, and non-binary employees represent 8.5% of the total. 

This interactive dashboard helps organizations strengthen equity, engagement, and retention strategies.
